This research line focuses on industrial and domestic cooling systems. An example is the production of LNG by innovative gas pre-treatment steps where cooling and separation of contaminants are combined. A new research line on simulation methods for transport in rarefied gas flows was recently initiated. The scientific challenge is in the combination of (rarefied) gas flow and phase transitions.
