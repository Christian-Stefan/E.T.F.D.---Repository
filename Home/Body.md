## Students

Students apply for our Energy Technology and Fluid Dynamics (ETFD) MSc program through the Master Allocation Procedure (MAP). 
Typically we welcome 30 new students each year. Your MSc program has a total duration of two academic years and has a value of 120 credit points (EC).  In consultation with your mentor, you select your courses. Your curriculum consists of core lectures (20 EC),  specialization courses lectured by professors from our Mechanical Engineering (ME) Department (20 EC), elective courses (15 EC), 2 professional skills courses (5 EC), an internship (15 EC), and finally your graduation project (45 EC). In our group we have three mentors: Prof. David Smeulders for all ME students in general, Prof. Harald van Brummelen for those with a strong preference for Computational Fluid Dynamics, and Dr. Rick de Lange for all SET students.
